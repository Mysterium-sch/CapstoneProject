# Ye Old Games

Welcome to our App!

We are Cocky's Coders and the minds behind Ye Old Games. During our senior year (2022-2023 School Year), we spent it visualizing, developing, and perfecting this app to the best of our abilities. This app was a cumulation of everything we have learned at the University of South Carolina, so we hope you enjoy our app as much as we have. 

## What is it, and How to play
Ye Old Games is a mobile gaming app with three central classics: Chess, Checkers, and Solitaire. When you first boot up the game, you only have access to Solitaire. The longer you play, the more points you earn. Once you earn enough points, you may purchase one of the following: couch co-op chess or checkers. Once one game has been purchased, restart and reach another. We wanted some progression to the app, but not make it feel taxing. Ultimately, this game is supposed to be relaxing, easy to play, and not time-consuming. We tailored the game to our User Demographic: busy people on the go who wanted something familiar to do during a commute or short lull.

The complete directions on downloading the source code are on our [Github Repository](https://github.com/Mysterium-sch/CapstoneProject), but I will summarize how to play using the most recent release. To use the app, download the [most recent release](https://github.com/Mysterium-sch/CapstoneProject/releases/tag/v1.0) to your mobile device (Android or IOS) and open it up - it's as simple as that. 

## There are several reasons you would want to play our app:
1. You are bored and want an easy-to-play game to which you do not have to dedicate hours to.
      1. The app is perfect for that since all games are "classics," so many people already know the rules.
      1. If you love the classic games you can play them all from this one app.
      1. There is also no campaign, so play the app for 10 minutes or an hour; it all depends on your time and what you want to give to it. 
1. You are learning how to play Chess, Checkers, or Solitaire and have friends willing to play with you.
      1. The game will not let you use illegal moves, so you will quickly pick up on rules while playing with your friends.
1. You are looking to kill some time with your friends IRL. 
      1. The game can be played "couch co-op" with friends, so sitting on a bus or an at home the game is a great way to play something fun by simply passing the phone back and forth!


## The Finished Project
As a final requirement for the project, we created a full demo video of our app that displays all features. [This video can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl9alz-hchs).

### There were several key aspects to our final product:

#### Splash Screen:
##### This screen is what users see before the home screen loads.
